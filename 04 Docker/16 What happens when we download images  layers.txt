a) docker run ubuntu:16.04
//shows 4 ids
id1: Downloading
id2: Downloaded
id3: Downloaded
id4: Downloaded


a) what are above 4 ids? Layers


b) What are layers? Image is immutable:

c) What is image made of? Collection of files and directories


d) What is ubuntu image above made of? 4 Images / files

Why Images are built of layers?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
How are these files / layers handy? Can reuse shared image files

-> mongodb image could have files that are also used in ubuntu image

Ex : installing mongodb
If we already have ubuntu image downloaded 
  ->can avoid downlaoding common files

About Layers

1) every layer has hash value
sha256:35562



a) How to get hash value?
$ docker images -q --no-trunc
sha256:fe3b34cb9255c.....
REPOSITORY	TAG	IMAGE ID		CREATED		SIZE
ubuntu		16.04	fe3b34cb9255	3 months ago	119 MB

//the image id = first values of hash value of image

b) how to check layers
docker inspect fe3b34cb9255

> 
"Layers" : [
	"sha256:d6021..."
	"sha256:1af..."
	"sha256:ea4b7..."
	"sha256:c6a4b7.."
]
 //4 layers in image , each layer has its own hash value

//When we download other images --->  it checks if any image layer is common , if yes avoids downloading it
HENCE FAST
Already Downloaded layer, not downlaoded again
