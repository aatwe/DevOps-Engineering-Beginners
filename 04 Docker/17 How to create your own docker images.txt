1) we only downloaded other images like mySQL,ubuntu ,mongodb etc

2) How to create our own container / docker file?

a)   
	touch Dockerfile

b) 
	FROM ubuntu					//Base image : every image has base image
	MAINTAINER abhilash atwe <abhi.atwe@gmail.com>	//
	RUN apt-get update				//
	CMD ["echo", "Hello My name is Abhi"]				//What exe to run when container has started  //commands given in array form
	
	//Docker file created



note: how to modify above file? vi Dockerfile


c) how to login to docker?
	d.1) login on website
	d.2) docker login
		Login
		Password

d)  how to build images?


	           //name	//path to docker file (we created docker file in Desktop folder)->current directory	
docker build -t myImage:1.01 .

//What happens here?
1) Sends build context to Daemon  //everything from desktop (docker folder) sent to daemon
	if dont want to send any -> add to .dockerignore

	//can do below to send form empty folder	//this time docker build command will be faster, earlier desktop had lots of files
	mkdir project
	mv Dockerfile project
	cd project

2) send FROM ubuntu

3) send CMD
	running in container id

e) How to check created Image 	
docker images
>myimage


f) Run the created image

docker run myimage 
>Hello my name is Kunal


WE HAVE CREATED OUR OWN IMAGE
//Same image will be visible on Docker Desktop
//can run the image  to create container etc do whatever you want
