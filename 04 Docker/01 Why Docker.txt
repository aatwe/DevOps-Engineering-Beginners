Companies have applications running


Where are the applciations running?
	Servers  / Data centres from cloud providers


Earlier practice/History:
	Only 1 application ran on 1 server
		200 people using application


	What when load increases?
		Need to run multiple application on a server.
		But no way to run multiple application on server
		How to keep application running for higher load?	Add/Buy a new server

	Every time new application -> buy new server
		XXX Very Bad XXX

 Solution?

VMware: Virtual machines

What are virtual machines?	
 Can run multiple application on single server

a) Problem:
 But virtual machines need their own OS --> new OS costs
dependency issues
//Still problem
b) Solution?
	What if we had isolation , without new OS

What is dual booting computer? one part of hard-disk: windows
			      other part : Ubuntu

Ubuntu doesnt know whats up in windows and vice versa	 

What if we can run all instances of application on same OS?

SOLUTION? CONTAINERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  What are containers?

Big companies used containers in a way
Container is like Virtual machine, just dont need new OS to use it


Scenario: You give your application website to friend saying its not working
	Earlier friend faced dependency issue when running on his

Now
you put all things that are needed with your code to be run in a box : Container


Q1) How multiple machines are created on host OS? Hypervisor
Q2) Virtual machines vs container
