We have a Client server architecture
client =docker CLI
Server =  Daemon

What docker contains? mainly container runtime


a) -Shipped Orchestration
		//What is orchestration? ex 10000 containers running application  > all have version 1 of app
		we have to update version 1 -> version 2
		How to update? Orchestration Engine : helps manage containers
		Ex Kubernetes 

            Docker CLI			//Client
            	|
        	REST API ex "docker run ubuntu" 
            	|
            	V
b) - Docker Engine / Docker Daemon	//Server
     	|		 
     	|  	//Dameon informs runtime, that abhilash wants to run ubuntu in container
     	|   		
     	V
c) -Container Runtime //allows to start and stop container 
   		 runc  //low level runtime	:   What this runtime does?  works with OS, starts and stops containers
		containerd  //high level runtime  What it does? manages runc, helps how to interact container with internet (pulling data etc)
		lxc,rocket rkp, cryo etc



Q1) What Daemon does?
a) listen to api requests
b) manage all docker object
	objects like: container,images,networks,volumes
