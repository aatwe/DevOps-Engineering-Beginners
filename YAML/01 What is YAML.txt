YAML files

Note: there are tools with which you can work with YAML files , without writing YAML code


YAML = YAML Aint Markup Language


What is a markup language?
	Child parent relationships


What is YAML? Data format
		What use? exchange data
			Similar to XML,  JSON data types

What can we store in YAML? Only Data
		                 DOES NOT CONTAIN Conditional Logic


What is storing this data called? Data serialization

What are objects? collection of data


Objective:
Given object on a computer, 
What if we want to share the object between android app, Web app, ML app? Different formats
What is the one format we can convert it into? YAML file


Summary :
Data object ----> YAML ----> Data object
	serializ	       deserializ




______________________________________________________________
How to share data in one single format? Serialization
What is Serialization? Converts data object 
			stored where? complex data structure
			Convert into? Stream of storage
				What is stream of storage? Byte Stream // chunks of data


Definition: Serialization is a process of converting data object (code+data) into series of bytes 
		Why convert series of bytes? to save the state of object
			This state of object is easily transmittable

A: For ex
How to store data into a device? Serialization
Given: File with data
//Serialization
1) Convert object into stream of data (chunks of bytes)
2) Store in required device storage / DB / YAML file/ Data serialization languages

Ex of data serialization languages? YAML, JSON, XML  

Q0) What is markup? use tags to define elements and add information
	for ex <i> Hello World </i>	-> is marked with <i> tag  ---> for the browser to display it as italic text

Q1)Why YAML is called not a markup language?
	HTML/XML : Use tag to define structure
	YAML 	  : Uses indentation not tags to define hierarchy


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B: How to do serialization? Serializer
	What is serialization output? YAML file


C: How to get data from that device & store in another?
//Deserialization 
1) get stream of data
2) convert stream of data back into object



D: How to do deserialization? 
1) Convert object into stream of bytes
2) Store object in YAML file 


 
How to convert stream of data back into database?Deserialization

Q0) What type of problem kubernetes solves?
After making an app
we want to run it on 10 servers + cloud. 
Limit set to 5 applications perserver

Kubernetes solves this: by creating a pod object
what object looks like? provided by YAML file

basically we will use yaml file data in kubernetes data pod

Q1) What type of data in yaml files?



Q2) Where is YAML used?
Dockert / Kubernetes config files (refer Q0)
logs, caches etc


Q3)What are benifits of YAML?
Human readable
Strict syntax  //not many mistake
indentation important
can convert to JSON/XML ez
Most languages use YAML
Complex data can be represented here in a more powerful way
Can use many tools with YAML (Parsers etc)
