CI is a vital tool first thing that should be automated in most pull request automation schemes

It is easy, dev should be writing these tests regardless
if you dont run tests automatically people will slowly break things and users will notice

from 1 to 10 dev

Dev work on a feature branch
They take most current files, branch off make a new copy of files, make changes to components, feature makes change to mobile app and website
On the branch they push it back to repository
repository runs the CI(CI is configured on repository side)
CI runs all tests programmer finds,
Result of tests attached to pull request
Pull request = dev asking to take their code and merge with central repository that user will be shown
In next deployment the features will be visible to users
