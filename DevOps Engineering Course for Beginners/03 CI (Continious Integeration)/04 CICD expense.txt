not very expensive


Central zGit repositories like
Github Gitlab and Bit Bucket

Have generous free tiers 
Even for org
some securiy and access control are paid


CI Providers : Layer CI(websites), Github Actions, Git Lab pipleines all have gnerous free tiers as well

Early on project CI provider does not matter much
