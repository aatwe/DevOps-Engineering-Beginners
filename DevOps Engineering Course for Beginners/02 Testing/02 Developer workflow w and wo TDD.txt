workflow Without TDD

1) Chose something to work on
	Based on idea in planning phase
2) Build based on specs
	Write code ,make build from that code
3) Test with small scripts
	Test it //write small scripts to make sure code is working correctly
		for ex pass values to sum function and check
	Tests written at the end codifty specifications
	
For ex 	Successfull coffe maker should 
	 heat up in 5 sec	//write test for this
	 brew coffee of sufficient strength  //write test for this 

With TDD //Developer write test before writing the code
	write tests that are currently failing
	write code until all specs have satisfied

1)  Chose something to work on
 
2) Write tests that would pass if product works
 
3) Keep building until all tests pass

Ex. :	Make a testing regimen that would work if coffee maker succeeded
	Build cheapest coffee maker that satisfies
	
Easier to write code if you write tests first
Forces to prioritize and think on important things
