Live chat-example : open source version of slack used as demo repo throughtlout layerCI internal documentation



For this open source version we want to run tests everytime developer proposes changes
In pull request tab we can know if the change was good


if dev changes color of website
	
dev goes to design file
services -> web - src -> main ->main.css -> edit the color

after making change
dont commit to main , instead
Create new branch -> Propose change -> Create pull request


Without a CI system all we can see is he file change and description
How to know if this will have negative sideeffects

Or i can run the changes locally, evaluate , or ask dev to screenshare and walk through

Very frictionful


CI allows dev to set comprehensive tests
lets check how to set up repository
