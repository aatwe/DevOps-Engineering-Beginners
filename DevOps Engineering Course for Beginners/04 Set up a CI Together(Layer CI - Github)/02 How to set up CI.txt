Go to repository 

Code -> services -> Cypress


What is Cypress? End to End testing service


What does it contain? Several configurations

What do these configurations do? Interact with the page with fake browser

We will make some tests to check if the change is not negatively affecting our customer workflows

for ex a test
enters username and password
logs in 
ensures user is actually logged in

Another test
goes to message area -> ENters random message 
Ensures message is submitted, viewable in remaining chat area

Enough end to end tests makes sure chat system keeps working

how to run these tests everytimes?
