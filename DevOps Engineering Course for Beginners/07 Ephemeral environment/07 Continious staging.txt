Ideais to merge staging ephemerial envt in CI piplines all together

This is layer CI itself


As ephemerial envt becomes powerful and easier to create
THr approach and overtake many aspects of many CI pipelines

If you cans etup website back end and database
It is easier to run tests 
Tests are easieer to run than backend

Logical conclusion : Concept becomes Continious staging where CI CD and Ephemerial env tform a single CICD flow


SIngle base takes all of the requirements for everything 


If production envt has many different microservices and many different databases
	it will be difficult to setup ephemerial envt

Large companies like FB has set it up for internal pull requests
They dontt hire develoiper teams/Infra stoftware engineers

Smaller companies : Stick to hosted service like Layer CIs
	Instead of making it yourself upto maybe you have 20 Dev
