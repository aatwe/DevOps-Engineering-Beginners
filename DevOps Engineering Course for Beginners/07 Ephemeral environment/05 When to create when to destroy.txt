Lifecycle:


1) When to create? 

2) When to destroy

Solution : Tie lifecycle of pull request to life cycle of ephemerial envt

If dev opens pull request -> create  environment for them
			keep it running 24/7
			Until dev leaves envt

What cost?
	If ephemerial envt costs 10% cheaper than production 
	If i have 30 pull requests -> my monthly costs quadruple

Expensive dev tool
