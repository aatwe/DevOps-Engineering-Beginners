1) Accelerates SDLC

2) Dev can review results visually

3) Dev can share work with non technical collaborators by just sharing link

4) Hard part = Dealing with databases and microservices
	By nature ephemerial envt are temporary ,
	   isolated from production envt and really only last as long as pull request does

	Reviewer should be able to delete a resource in review
	They should be able to see if deleting a user still works without fear of affecting	 	production envt

	In early implementation , makes sense to connect to API servers with read only 	permissions through staging Database

	ENd goal = have fresh copy of database for every commit
	Every time developer proposes change -> they get new ddatabase for their environment
