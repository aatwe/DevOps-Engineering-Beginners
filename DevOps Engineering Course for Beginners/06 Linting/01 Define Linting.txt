Code Automation Tool
Used to catch bugs

Any team with >1 developer working in same codebase should setup linter
linters are programs that look at program's source code and finds problems automatically
Common feature of pull request automation
Make sure obvious bugs do not make to production

Early products can avoid tests just by usinglinters

Ex. 
var x ="5";
function f(elements) {console.log(elements)	//not good practice
let x = 0;	//confusing	//var named same in innerscope
while(x < 100)  {		//while goes on forever		
	console.log(x)} 		//messses indent
}


Use style guides : Google style guides

Developers should not wait for human reviewer to let them now if thier code is linted and styled correctly

Hence Automatic linting
