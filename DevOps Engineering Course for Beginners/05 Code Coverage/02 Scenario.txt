we ahve a complicated code base
wiht existing users

we want to enforce tests are written so things are not broken

For Ex

let f = n => {
  let x = "hello", result = [];
  for(let i = 0; i< n; i++) {			//Branch lines //change flow
	result.push(x+i);			//logic line //change behaviour
	if(i%50 == 49) {
	   result.push("50th: " +x+i)
	}				//syntax lines //dont do anything
}
	return result;
}



Code Coverage = total # of non-syntax lines with tests / total # of non-syntax lines

Consider test :

it("should work for two". () => {
 let expected = {"hello0", "hello1"};
 assertEquals(f(2), expected);
)

//Since input = 2 , if statement  wont execute
if(i%50 == 49) {
	   result.push("50th: " +x+i)
	}	

So we are executing : 5/6 lines = 83% test coverage
