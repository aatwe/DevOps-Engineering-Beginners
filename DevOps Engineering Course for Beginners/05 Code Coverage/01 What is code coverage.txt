Quantitatively measure of how comprehensive codebase tests are

Code Coverage = total # of non-syntax lines with tests / total # of non-syntax lines


Code coverage increases when stability increases and bugs reduce

Code coverage graph =  graph of rectangles

each reactangle = file
color = how many tests

Bright green = 100% file tested
Bright red   = none of the file is tested
