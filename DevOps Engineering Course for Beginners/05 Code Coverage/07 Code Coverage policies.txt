1) When you inherit a codebase 
	Code coverage must not decrease
	If current code has 75 % lines tested, you introduce 40 lines , atleast 30 of yours 	should be tested, dont decrease the average 

demerit is expense of developer speed



merits: Harder to test changes like integerations will be less likely to be worked on by 	developers 
	Developers are incentivized to make more features per scrum cycle
	If certain features are harder to tests, those features are harder to make and test, developers will be less likely to make them regardless of whether they are important to users or nots'

Better for org to have exemptions, if it is going for code coverage not decrease policy


2) Code owners for test files
	Define code owners for tests
	Dev can change implementation details without reviewers 
	Logic changes in test should be approved by senior dev or manager

 .spec.js @engineering-manager-username
If there is a file called code owner, eng manager shouold approve any change which changes the test
