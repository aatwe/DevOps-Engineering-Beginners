How to test datree? one needs kubernetes config file

//demo kubernetes file


cat ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml


//king : Deployment
  containers: 
	 
	name:  rss-reader
	...





Q1) How datree works?
	many rules in kubernetes for 
		containers,workloads,Cronjobs,networking
		
	ex of rule: container does not have image tag -> give error



Q2) Preprovided 30 Datree tools

how to run 30 built in rules?

a) datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml

			//What is this? path to the file



b) what happens? datree is running 30 built in rules
	where are the rules run? locally
	why its cool? we didnt set up any cluster / miniKube cluster yet	//deployment phase running
						

	Check which policy checks worked
		 which policy checks failed


//How datree is validating?
	a) validate/Checks if correct yaml
		ex error: no proper indentation / extra bracket etc
	
	b) Kubernetes schema validation
		ex error: change kind: deployment -> something not supported	/ typo

	c) Policy Check:

		c.1) Check if each container's image has tag version		//failed

		//try testing again: ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml 
		//what error? Says the below image does not have a version.	//hence failing
		image: nginx:latest



		//How to see in GUI?
		Datree -> Dashboard -> History			//check which checks failed/ which passed / which file ran/ 	
		//Can see error: Ensure each container image has a pinned(tag) version


		c.2) Ensure each container has configured memory limit
		Ex. in yaml file : 
		limits:
		  cpu: "500m"	//memory limit not provided // cpu limit provided

		c.3) Ensure workload has valid labels

		c.4) Ensure each container has configured liveness probe



//How to turn off policies?
dashboard -> policies ->
	Turn few error ones off
	Run test again
	datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml



Q) How is this different from checks provided by kubeCTL?
	can customize error message




Q) Lets try changing the yaml file


1) ~sudo vi ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml

2) add a extra {

3) run the test
datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml
	//why yaml validation first, schema validation second,  policy checks 3rd?  file should be in correct order first
