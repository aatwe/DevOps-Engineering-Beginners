1) How to implement these changes in CI pipeline?


~  datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml -p Kunals_Test



2) How is changes and history etc reflected in dashboard , from our own CLI? token


3) What is this? token from our account
	(profile -> settings -> token)

	What this token does? connects dashboard --> local setup


4) Can we get this token from config file?
	~cat ~/.datree/config.yaml

	>token: fs9f8s9d8f7s9df89etc


5) What if we using CI pipeline? 
	we have to setup installation of datree on someone else's machine on team

	How to setup on his machine?
	a) Override the new device's account token
		How to override his/her account token?

		1) export environment variable
			export DATREE_TOKEN=dfhgfgfghdgf

		

		2) override account token via config file
			if device ran any policy check from CLI, can override token present in config.yaml file

		~/.datree/config.yaml


	Q) What if device never ran policy check before?
		create a new file in same location //above
		write inside that file

		~ sudo cat ~/.datree/config.yaml
		token: gugf9d8fgu9d8fg90
		
		//can just add above line in manually created file, if we havent run a checkbefore

	
		3)Using datree CLI

		~datree config set tokenfu9s8df9s8duyf9s8		//this will replace the token inside config file(~/.datree/config.yaml)
