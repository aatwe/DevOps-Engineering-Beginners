	we want different policy checks

Solution by Datree? Policy management

	policy with different rules config

2) give use cases custom policies



How to creat policy?


1) policies -> Create policy ->  Give name -> Create -> abhi_test


2) abhi_test
	0/30 rules active
	//activate whatver rules we want
	//change to your own message name



3) How to run our file against this custom policy?

~ datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml		//Runs defualt policy datree provides

	

~ datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml	-p abhi_test		//Run our own policy
