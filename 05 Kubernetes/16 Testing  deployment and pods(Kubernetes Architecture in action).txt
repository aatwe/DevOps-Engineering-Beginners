6) How to see all? pods + services + deployments + replicas	
kubectl get all
pods
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-664ae567...	1.1	Running
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-643ae567...	1.1	Running
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-634ae567...	1.1	Running
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-675ae567...	1.1	Running

//4 pods running

services
deployments
							//How are 4 pods running above? we tell deployment
	deployment.apps/nginx-deployment	4/4		// Here in deployment section, we tell deployment to always have 4 pods ready"
replicas

Q1) where is deployment in hierarchy?

 deployment 
     pod 
       container

Q2) Lets test : What if we try to delete the pod
a)  kubectl gets 4 pods
b) delete pod nginx-deploymentt-664ae567...
	//pod gets deleted

c) kubectl get pods
	//it started again  *MAGIC* We deleted a pod, but based on rule it started again
				//control manager always listening to api server



d) Check our deployments
	kubectl get deployments

e) Delete deployment
 kubectl delete deployments nginx-deployment
	//deployment deleted

f)Check pods again
	kubectl get pod
	//
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-664ae567...	1.1	Terminating
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-643ae567...	1.1	Terminating
       pod/nginx-deploymentt-634ae567...	1.1	Terminating
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-675ae567...	1.1	Terminating  //why? deployment deleted

//Architecture in action
