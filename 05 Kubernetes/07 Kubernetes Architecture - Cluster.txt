1) Kubernetes Cluster
	Control Plane + Worker Nodes

			   worker node
			/
CubeCTL --> Control plane	
			\
			  worker node


//Kubernetes Cluster = Collection of control plane (called master node earlier)  and worker nodes


worker node = where application running
Control plane = manages worker nodes
CubeCTL -> Kubernetes CLI //terminal
Orchestration = managing micro services	
		where micro services running? worker nodes

Flow:
CubeCTL --> tells --> Control plane //start 10 applications
Control plane will look which worker node is empty + handle load --> starts the container


How cubectl communicates?
	1) Declarative
		Create a manifest file, YAML files code
	2) Imperative
		Tell cluster specific commands  //bad //everytime have to write commands
