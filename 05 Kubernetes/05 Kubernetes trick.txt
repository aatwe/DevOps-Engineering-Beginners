What is kubernetes?

use case 1: always 5 application should be running, if any goes down restart -> scheduler does it



Why  kubernetes = more than container orchestrato?

Kubernetes helps usDeploy, zero downtime features, scale, self Heal 		//Orchestration
								
+ other features (replicate app, load balancing services)
//can run kubernetes on own cloud, can run on own machine, can migrate, replicate,scale,zero tolerant, volumes,external storage ,logs, load balancing,service discovery, secret info


													
just tell kubernetes via api to run website application on 2 servers , allocate x memory to it


How kubernetes does it? kubernetes problem
