1) minikube docker-env
	//Output: environment variables
	//why download envt variables? variables required for local docker client to communicate with remote servers
	//where is docker server running? inside a virtual machine
	

2) How to check docker containers running
>docker container ls		//what containers are these? required by kubernetes


3) Everything running inside this VMd, is running inside container
	How can we check it?
	

a) Check all container running into minCube	
	minikube ssh
	docker ps	//list all containers running //where running? inside pods

	1	
	2
	3
	...

b)  Check all pods that are running
	>kubectl get pods
What is inside these pods? containers


4) kubectl config view	//List all kubeconfig files : info about cluster

5) How to check current context?
	minikube


6) How to see all? pods + services + deployments + replicas	
kubectl get all
pods
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-664ae567...	1.1	Running
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-643ae567...	1.1	Running
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-634ae567...	1.1	Running
        pod/nginx-deploymentt-675ae567...	1.1	Running

//4 pods running

services
deployments
							//How are 4 pods running above? we tell deployment
	deployment.apps/nginx-deployment	4/4		// Here in deployment section, we tell deployment to always have 4 pods ready"
replicas

7) where is deployment in hierarchy?

 deployment 
     pod 
       container
