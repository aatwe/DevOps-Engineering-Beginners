1) How to port forward?
	 we go to port 8080 :80 of local host
	nginx-pod 8080:80		//nginx runs on port 80
				//everything is running on top of linux
				//we can go inside pod and execute linux command


2) go to web: localhost:8080
We can access nginx



WHAT MAGIC HERE? THIS Nginx is running inside kubernetes inside our pod in a container
we can see outputs also in terminal -> when we refresh

		//what is inside nginx-pod container?image with OS

//stop in terminal -> wont be able to access
