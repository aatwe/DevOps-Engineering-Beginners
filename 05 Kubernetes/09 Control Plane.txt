  	      |	    Linux			       |	//control panel runs on top of linux
	      |				       |
	       -------------------------------------------------		
a) API Server:
All comm happen via api server
exposes RESTful API	
What input? YAML files  //contains pod definition	
			  which container, which image, what what to run
				how to send yaml ? over https  //post method //port 443	
	  //also called as kubernetes manifest yaml files
	//Monocole tool helps if dont like to work with yaml files , can create pods etc without working with yaml files


b) ETCD:DB Tool : stores configuration info about cluster 			

c) Controller manager:  
	what are controllers? make sure desired state we want (for ex run 5 pods) , controller does that
	what are controller managers? takes care of controllers
		we tell api server, it listens to api server //request 5 pods
	Controller manager has functionalities:
		c.1) desired state : what we want
		c.2) current state : checks what is current state //loops
		c.3) Differences   : 
		c.4) make changes :
	Cloud providers; have their own control managers, for load balancing etc

d) Scheduler
	what are schedulers? physically schedule objects
		we tell api server, it listen to api server  //request 5 pods
	Scheduler will check for healthy nodes, finds best worker node and Schedules on worker node	
		checks if node has free resources, networking requirements, images for running container are dowloaded?, whats running on node		
			--> allocates task to node
	Scheduler criterias
		d.1) Container creating
		d,2) Container scheduling
		d.3) Container pending state		//what if cant find worker node free to do
