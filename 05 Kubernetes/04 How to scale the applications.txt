Given:
Microservices running
100 containers running


A) If more people start using website -> Server load increases 
	Solution?
1) Create more applications , distribute load over servers


B) What if 200/1000 container get damaged? want to restart them
C) How to deploy application / update with 0 down time?

Orchestrators
What are orchestrators?Kubernetes provide orchestration + Scheduling tools to containers	
							What scheduler does?
								use case 1: always 5 application should be running, if any goes down restart -> scheduler does it
								use case 2: allocate only 2 GB ram to application-> scheduler does it

a) What does Orchestrator do? helps deply and manage application dynamically (on its own)
	How it does dynamically? KUBERNETES
	use cases provided:
	for ex if more people using -> scale up application
 	           if something went down -> Restart / heal container	

Kubernetes helps:		//also features of cloud native applications
-Deploy
-Zero downtime updates
-Scale
-Self Heal containers

What are cloud native apps?
Applications that follow these principles ---> Applications that run on Kubernetes


What is cloud computing?
Take resources from cloud ; Ram / Server

Q) Can cloud native apps run on cloud computing platforms? Yes , anywhere , even on local system

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Wherever Kubernetes : Can run Cloud native applications
