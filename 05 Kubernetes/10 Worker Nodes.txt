a) Kube proxy: Responsible for networking
		networking part of cluster
		Helps cluster communicate with outside network
		gives each worker node unique ip address

b) Kubelet :present on every worker node  
		when worker node gets attached to control plane, kubelet is installed
		Kubelet listens to API server

	   What if worker node kublet cant allocate node?
		Report back to control plane
		     API Server will work with scheduler and try to schedule since worker node cant schedule


c) Container runtime:
		Does container related things
			pulling image	
			pushing image
			create container out of it
			stop container
			destroy container etc

Does Kubernetes support docker?
used to
But now docker replaced by cncf


Why replaced? Docker does not support  CRI: Container runtime interface
	            Contained supports
