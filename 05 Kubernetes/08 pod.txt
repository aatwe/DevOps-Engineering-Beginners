What is pod?

smallest Scheduline unit in kubernetes
Inside pod we run containers

-Worker node
--Container runtime (containerd)
---pod
----container



How many container in a pod? good practice 1 container 1 pod 



Q) How to create pod?

1) Create web application

2) Divide web application into microservices

3)Containerize microservice: Add microservice in its container

4) Put every container in its own pod

5) Deploy pods to controllers in kubernetes
	What are controllers? loops that watch state of kubernetes cluster, make/request changes where needed
			each controller tries to move cluster state closer to desired state
	ex objective: tell kubernetes to always run 5 pods
		give info to controller
			which controller? deployment controller  (what is deployment? another type of object)
				what will controller do? handle to run 5 pods at all times
						      if one pod goes, it will auto restart it
